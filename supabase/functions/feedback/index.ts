/**
 * The relay behind Settings -> Make Nila Yours.
 *
 * It takes a message the app has already composed and hands it to Resend, which
 * puts it in my inbox. Two things it does not take on trust:
 *
 *  1. Who sent it. The address is read from the caller's Supabase session, not
 *     from the request body, so the "from" line in my inbox cannot be spoofed
 *     by anything the client says.
 *  2. That the sender wants a reply sent into the void. That verified address
 *     becomes the mail's reply-to, so hitting Reply in my mail client writes
 *     back to the person who registered with Nila, with no address to copy out
 *     by hand and no admin screen to build.
 *
 * Note this is the one thing in Nila that crosses the encryption boundary by
 * design: a message is written to be read by a person, so it travels as text.
 * The app never puts logged health data in it.
 *
 * Deploy and configuration: see README.md beside this file.
