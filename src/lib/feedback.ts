// A message is composed here and handed to the outbox, which sends it now or
// keeps it until there is a connection. This file only decides what the message
// says; feedbackOutbox.ts decides when it travels.
//
// Replies go back to the address on the sender's account. The relay sets it as
// the mail's reply-to, taken from their session rather than from anything the
// app sends up, so answering the email answers the person who wrote it.
//
// Nothing here touches health data. A message is the sender's own words, typed
// to be read by a person, so it travels as plain text while everything they log
// stays encrypted. The footer carries a version and a device and nothing else.
//
// Everything in this file is pure on purpose: it is the part worth testing, and
// it must not drag the Supabase client into the test run.
